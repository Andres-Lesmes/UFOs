# UFOs
## Overview of the Analysis
  In this module we are creating a table with some data of reported UFOs sightings. In this table we are including the date, city, state, country, shape, duration in minutes and comments about each sighting ocurrence. We are displaying this table on a webpage so users specially UFOs enthusiasts can have access to some data on UFOs sightings. We are creating 5 different filters so users can filter the data by date, city, state, country and shape. 
## Results
  By using the filter criteria an user can filter the data by inputing one or more filtering variables. The user will type the criteria for which sightings he wants to observe the data and after hitting enter the program will filter and display those sightings that match the user input. For example, an user can type us in the country box and triangle in the shape box. So the table will display all the sightings that ocurred in the us with a shape of triangle.
